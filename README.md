# Introduction

This lovelace card is created for the purpose of collecting all relevant data about your 3D Printer.  
For the design I have been heavily inspired by the awesome [vacuum-card](https://github.com/denysdovhan/vacuum-card) by [Denys Dovhan](https://github.com/denysdovhan).

# Intallation

## HACS (Not Ready Yet)

## Manual

1. Download the `octoprint-card.js` file from the [Releases Page](https://github.com/kasperlaursen/octoprint-card/releases)
2. Upload the file to your Home Assistant `config/local` folder
3. Add a reference to the card to your lovelace instance  
   Go to `Configuration` ‚Üí `Lovelace Dashboards` ‚Üí `Resources Tab` ‚Üí `Click Plus button`.  
   **Url:** `/local/vacuum-card.js`  
   **Resource type:** `JavaScript Module`  
   _Note: If you do not see the Resources Tab, you will need to enable Advanced Mode in your User Profile_
4. Add the custom:octoprint-card to Lovelace UI as you normally would!

There are currently no Configuration UI, copy the yaml from below to and modify the properties to fit your installation.

### Configuration example

```yaml
type: "custom:octoprint-card"
bedActual: sensor.octoprint_actual_bed_temp
bedTarget: sensor.octoprint_target_bed_temp
toolActual: sensor.octoprint_actual_tool0_temp
toolTarget: sensor.octoprint_target_tool0_temp
currentState: sensor.octoprint_current_state
timeElapsed: sensor.octoprint_time_elapsed
timeRemaining: sensor.octoprint_time_remaining
jobPercentage: sensor.octoprint_job_percentage
printing: binary_sensor.octoprint_printing
imageUrl: /local/printer.svg
videoSource: camera.prusa_3d_printer
octoPrintUrl: http://192.168.50.116/
```

# Development

I though I would give som technical background about the project, and also let you know how you can contribute.

## Why Svelte?

The most common framework used for Lovelace cards seems to be `lit-element` but I chose to jump on the [Svelte](https://svelte.dev) hype train and learn something different.

This is my first "Real project" using Svelte and I think it is a simple and easy framework to use.

## Goals

### Short Term

The project has just begun, and I have a lot of ideas for improvement!  
On the [project board](https://github.com/kasperlaursen/octoprint-card/projects/1) you can see the planed tasks for the v1 release!

### Mid term

Custom actions based on Home Assistant Scripts.  
Some sort of nice looking Temperature Charts.  
Making a custom animated svg progress indicator resembling a printer printing a Benchy.

### Long term

The current Octoprint integration in Home Assistant does not really seem complete to me.  
I think there are a lot of possible improvements and additions. So in the long run i hope to be able to contribute to that as well, and update this Card to have even more functionality.

Adding Printer Play/Pause/Stop actions.  
Starting a print for existing g-code.

# How to Contribute

I Would love to wee what ideas you have. Any contributions are happily welcomed!

1. Fork the repo.
2. Make your changes on your fork ([How to run locally](#Running-locally))
3. Open a Pull Request from your fork against the main branch.
4. Remember to add a nice description of what your changes are intended to do.
5. I will get back to you as soon as possible!

## Running locally

1. Clone this repository to your local machine

```
git clone https://github.com/kasperlaursen/octoprint-card.git
```

2. Go to the folder

```
cd octoprint-card
```

3. Install dependencies

```
npm install
```

3. Start the local development server, which will recompile the code on file changes.

```
npm run dev
```

4. Add the dev card to your Lovelace resources using the url `http://localhost:5000/octoprint-card-dev.js`

5. Add the card to your dashboard with `type: 'custom:octoprint-card-dev'` and the rest of [the config](#Configuration-example)

## Prerequisite

To run the project locally you need to have [node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) installed on your machine.
